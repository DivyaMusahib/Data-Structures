******************** 
Binary Tree -> tree whose nodes have max two children

usage 
use to represent hierarchical data structure 
use to retrieve data quickly , hash map retrieves the data in O(1) but that is average but binary tree retrieves data in log(n) time every time


-------- example of binary tree ------
