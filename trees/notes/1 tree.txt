-> tree is a data structure which is used to represent naturally hierarchical data.
// but sometimes data is not hierarchical we might use tree data structure to access data fast

// for eg : auto correct , internal hard disk is a hierarchical data structure , sql query all are stored using tree

-> tree is a logical model where there are nodes , links/edges , 
-> edges represent the relationship between the data

-> combination of nodes , and relationship are known as graph
-> tree is special kind of graph
-> unlike graph tree cannot have cycle
-> a tree is a acyclic connected graph


-------------- Terminologies Of Tree -------------

root node       -> top node
parent node     -> the first node which i get going towards root node is parent
child node
sibling node    -> nodes with same parent
leaf node       -> Node with no children
depth of node   -> #of edges required to reach root node from a present node
                depth of siblings are same
                depth(node) = 1 + depth(parent node)
                not defined for tree only for a particular node
height of node  -> number of edges required to reach the farthest leaf node
                height of leaf node is 0
height of tree  -> height of root node is height of entire tree

(height + depth ) of a node = height of tree
